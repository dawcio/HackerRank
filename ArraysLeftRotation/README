A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left.

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of (the number of integers) and (the number of left rotations you must perform). The second line contains space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state.

Output Format

Print a single line of space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing left rotations.
